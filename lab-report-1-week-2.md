    <h1 align="center">CSE 15L: Course-specific Account and Ieng6 Computer</h1>
    </p>
</p>

---

## What is a course-specific account?

* A course-specific account is an account created for students in specific courses (i.e., CSE 12, CSE 15L, etc...)
* These accounts grant students access to specific resources that they can use to do assignments in the class.
* An example of a course-specific account look like this: cse15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
* The "zz" is replaced by specific assigned letters to each student.

## How to gain access to a course-specific account?
* First, in order to gain access to a course-specific account, you must go to https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php and look up your assigned account address.

* Second, you will then need to enter your UCSD username and Student ID, which will prompt information about what course-specific account belongs to your student ID.

* You will be asked to change your password in order to activate your course-specific account. (Note: this process will take some time and depend on the traffic load on the server.)
